[Slides for the talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p4vqf8EH2wvNsbv9Wx_hOGRoxUwIXAElIIvzIv1II5M/edit?usp=sharing)

If I ever get the time I’d like to get this cleaned up and deployed, but for now it will remain in the spike state it’s currently in.

## Setup

See [wasm-bindgen readme](https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasm-bindgen) for setup instructions if you want to run this locally. You will need to have [cat-lox](https://github.com/AaronStGeorge/cat-lox) cloned locally as well in the location specified by the [cargo.toml](https://github.com/AaronStGeorge/rust-wasm-talk/blob/master/Cargo.toml).

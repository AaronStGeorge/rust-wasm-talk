 # rust-wasm-talk
Code for GDG Missoula talk about rust and wasm.  

If I ever get the time I’d like to get this cleaned up and deployed, but for now it will remain in the spike state it’s currently in.

See [wasm-bindgen readme](https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasm-bindgen) for setup instructions if you want to run this locally.
